## Data description

This data comes from <https://www.basketball-reference.com/wnba/players/> and contains information on WNBA basketball players from the 2019 season. The data was originally collected for the book [*Bayes Rules! An Introduction to Applied Bayesian Modeling*](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/) and was included in the [{bayesrules} package](https://bayes-rules.github.io/bayesrules/docs/index.html) as `basketball`.

There are 33 columns, and [they're documented here](https://bayes-rules.github.io/bayesrules/docs/reference/basketball.html)---make sure you consult that page!

For this exercise, you'll only really worry about these columns (but you're free to use any others for your extension if you want!):

| Variable        | Definition                                                        |
|:----------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `total_minutes` | Total number of minutes played throughout the season              |
| `games_played`  | Number of games played throughout the season                      |
| `starter`       | True if player started in more than half of the games they played |
| `avg_points`    | Average number of points scored per game                          |
| `age`           | Player age                                                        |

The code below loads the data. **You don't need to modify anything in this chunk of code---you only need to run it.**

```{r}
#| label: load-data
#| warning: false
#| message: false

wnba <- read_csv("data/wnba.csv")
```

## Combining plots with {patchwork}

Make three plots from the `wnba` data:

1. A histogram showing the distribution of player age (you'll probably want to use a binwidth of 1 so you can show bars with whole years)
2. A scatterplot showing the relationship between average points (`x`) and total minutes (`y`), colored by `starter`
3. A scatterplot showing the relationship between games played (`x`) and total minutes (`y`), colored by `starter`

**Combine these three plots with {patchwork}**. Look at [the documentation](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/articles/guides/assembly.html) to see fancy ways of combining them, like having two rows inside a column.

```{r}
#| label: combine-plots

# Make some plots and combine them here
```


## Visualizing regression

### Recreate model

Use the `wnba` data to create a model that predicts the total number of minutes a WNBA player played based on their average points, whether they're a starter, and the number of games they played in 2019 (hint: the formula will look like this: `total_minutes ~ avg_points + starter + games_played`)

Use `lm()` and `tidy()` to recreate this table:

```r
model_minutes_results <- tidy(model_minutes, conf.int = TRUE)
model_minutes_results

#> # A tibble: 4 × 7
#>   term         estimate std.error statistic  p.value conf.low conf.high
#>   <chr>           <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
#> 1 (Intercept)    -140.     16.8       -8.37 5.06e-14   -174.     -107. 
#> 2 avg_points       30.8     2.93      10.5  1.82e-19     25.0      36.6
#> 3 starterTRUE     172.     19.9        8.66 9.70e-15    133.      212. 
#> 4 games_played     14.9     0.832     17.9  3.46e-38     13.2      16.5
```

```{r}
#| label: recreate-me-1

# Do stuff here
```

### Recreate coefficient plot

Run the code chunk below to see a plot.

```{r}
#| label: recreate-me-2
#| message: false
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("images/recreate-me-2-1.png")
```

This is a coefficient plot and it shows the partial slopes (or effect) of each of the explanatory variables in the model. Holding all else equal, a one-point increase in a player's average points is associated with ≈30 more total minutes played in a season; being a starter is associated with ≈170 more total minutes played in a season; and so on.

Use `geom_pointrange()` in the chunk below to re-create the coefficient plot.

- *Do not* try to plot the results of `lm()` directly. You need to feed the model you create to `tidy()` to create a plottable data frame:

  ```r
  your_model <- lm(...)

  data_to_plot <- tidy(your_model, conf.int = TRUE)
  ```

- You'll need to calculate confidence intervale to plot the `xmin` and `xmax` values. Do this by setting `conf.int = TRUE` inside `tidy()`.

- You'll need to remove the intercept. Use something like `filter(term != "(Intercept)")`

- The plot uses `theme_light()`

- Use `\n` to add line breaks in the label (like `labs(title = "Really long\ntext")`)

```{r}
#| label: recreate-me-2

# Do stuff here
```


### Recreate predicted values

Run the code chunk below to see a plot.

```{r}
#| label: recreate-me-3
#| message: false
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("images/recreate-me-3-1.png")
```

This shows what happens to the predicted number of total minutes as a typical player increases the number of games they've played—unsurprisingly, it goes up! This is actually the same stuff we saw in the coefficient plot—the slope for `games_played` here is ≈15, so total minutes increases by 15 for each game played; the coefficient for `starter` is 172, so the line is 172 minutes higher for starters.

Use `predictions()` (from the {marginaleffects} package) and `geom_line()` and `geom_ribbon()` in the chunk below to re-create the predictions plot.

- Refer to the ["Predicted values and marginal effects in 2026"](https://datavizsp26.classes.andrewheiss.com/example/07-example.html#predicted-values-and-marginal-effects-in-2026) section of the example page!

- You'll need to create a dataset of predicted values first. You'll do something like this:

  ```r
  my_predictions <- predictions(
    NAME_OF_YOUR_MODEL,
    newdata = datagrid(
      games_played = seq(1, 34, by = 1),
      starter = c(FALSE, TRUE)
    )
  )
  ```

- To get the color and fill correct on both the line and the ribbon, you'll need to use the fill aesthetic in `geom_ribbon()` and the color aesthetic in `geom_line()`.

```{r}
#| label: recreate-me-3

# Do stuff here
```


# Task 3: Extension

Try one of these things for your extension:

- **Different model**: Interact `starter` with `games_played` in the model (do this by multiplying the variables instead of adding them, like `starter * games played`) and make a predicted values plot. Interpret the plot. What's different about this version of the model?
- **Correlogram**: Create a correlogram heatmap, either with `geom_tile()` or with points sized by the correlation. Use any variables you want from `wnba`.
- **Anything else**: The theme for this week is relationships, so do something neat to show how different variables are related in the `wnba` data.

**This is your chance to play around and explore.**

```{r}
#| label: extension

# Do stuff here
