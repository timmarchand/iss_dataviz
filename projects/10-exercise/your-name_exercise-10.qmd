# Task 1: Session check-in

Three interesting or exciting things:

1. Something
2. Something
3. Something

Three muddy or unclear things:

1. Something
2. Something
3. Something


# Task 2: Following a style guide and enhancing plots

## Data description

This data comes from the [Urban Institute](https://datacatalog.urban.org/dataset/state-state-spending-kids-dataset). You already used this data in Exercise 6---refer to it for more details about what the different columns mean.

## Recreating a publication-worthy plot

For this exercise, you don't need to worry about any data manipuluation or anything. I've given you all the code you need to run.

Instead, your job is to take a ggplot plot and enhance it, following the guidelines from an organizational style guide. You'll use Illustrator, Inkscape, or some other vector editing program to recreate this image:

![](img/enhanced-plot.svg){width="100%"}

The code below (1) loads and cleans the data, (2) creates a barebones plot with {ggplot2}, and (3) saves that plot as both a vector-based PDF and a vector-based SVG. **You don't need to modify anything in this chunk of code---you only need to run it.**

```{r}
#| label: load-data-make-base-plot
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| fig-width: 6.25
#| fig-height: 3
#| out-width: "70%"
#| fig-align: center

library(tidyverse)
library(scales)

# If you're using Windows, this will load the Lato font into your R session (But
# only if you've installed it on your computer first! Make sure you do that!)
#
# If you're not using Windows, you don't have to do this (and this code won't 
# run---it'll only run on Windows). But still make sure the font is installed.
if (.Platform$OS.type == "windows") {
  windowsFonts(`Lato` = windowsFont("Lato"))
}

# Load and clean kids data
kids <- read_csv("data/kids.csv") |>
  # These values are stored as 1000s of dollars, so this scales them 
  # back up by multiplying them by 1000
  mutate(across(c(raw, inf_adj, inf_adj_perchild), \(x) x * 1000))

kids_k12 <- kids |> 
  filter(variable == "PK12ed") |> 
  filter(state %in% c("Virginia", "Georgia", "North Carolina", "Kentucky"))

plot_kids_south <- ggplot(
  kids_k12,
  aes(x = year, y = inf_adj_perchild, color = state)
) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 2.5, pch = 21, fill = "white", stroke = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    limits = c(1996, 2016),
    breaks = seq(1996, 2016, by = 2),
    expand = expansion(mult = 0.02)
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(3800, 8000), labels = label_currency()) +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c("#ec008b", "#fdbf11", "#1696d2", "#000000"),
    guide = "none"
  ) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  theme_minimal(base_family = "Lato") +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "#DEDDDD"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    axis.line.x = element_line(color = "#000000"),
    # Leave some extra space on the right margin for manual direct labels
    plot.margin = margin(t = 2, r = 50, b = 2, l = 2)
  )

# Save the plot as a vector image for later editing/enhancing
ggsave(
  plot_kids_south, filename = "base_plot.pdf", device = cairo_pdf,
  width = 6.25, height = 3, units = "in", bg = "transparent"
)

ggsave(
  plot_kids_south, filename = "base_plot.svg",
  width = 6.25, height = 3, units = "in", bg = "transparent"
)

# Show the barebones plot
plot_kids_south
```

## Finished version

Include your finished version of the plot here! Place the exported PDF or PNG in the same folder as this `.qmd` file and use Markdown syntax to include the image in the document.

DO THAT HERE.


# ~~Task 3: Extension~~

There is no extension for this exercise! You'll be doing more of this in Mini Project 2 and in the final project.
