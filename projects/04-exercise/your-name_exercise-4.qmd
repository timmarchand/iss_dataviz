# Task 2: Long Beach Animal Shelter

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Load libraries here
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data description and cleaning

This data comes from the [City of Long Beach Animal Care Services](https://www.longbeach.gov/acs/) via the [{animalshelter}](https://emilhvitfeldt.github.io/animalshelter/) R package (and it was a [#TidyTuesday dataset in March 2025](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-03-04/readme.md)).

There are 22 columns, and [they're documented here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-03-04/readme.md#data-dictionary)---make sure you consult that page!

The code below loads and cleans the data, mostly by filtering it to include the most common types of animals, intake types, and outcome types. **You don't need to modify anything in this chunk of code---you only need to run it.**

```{r}
#| label: load-clean-data
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Load the full data
animals_raw <- read_csv("data/animals.csv")

animals <- animals_raw |> 
  # Only keep the most common animals, intake types, and outcome types
  filter(animal_type %in% c("bird", "cat", "dog", "wild", "other")) |>
  filter(intake_type %in% c("owner surrender", "stray", "wildlife")) |>
  filter(
    outcome_type %in%
      c("outcome_type", "rescue", "adoption", "euthanasia", "transfer",
        "return to owner", "shelter, neuter, return", "died",
        "community cat", "return to wild habitat")
  ) |>
  # Add columns for the year and month
  mutate(
    intake_year = year(intake_date),
    intake_month = month(intake_date, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    across(c(animal_type, intake_type, outcome_type), 
    \(x) str_to_title(x))
  )
```


## Animal type

What are the most common type of animals seen by the shelter?

### Recreate data summary

Right now there's a row for each animal visit. We need to condense that down to get counts of different types of variables. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarize()`.

Use `group_by()` and `summarize()` to create a data frame named `animal_counts` that looks like this (hint---in `summarize()`, you'll want to use the `n()` function to calculate the number of rows in each group):

```
# A tibble: 5 × 2
  animal_type total
  <chr>       <int>
1 Bird         1952
2 Cat         13367
3 Dog          8448
4 Other        1280
5 Wild         1366
```

```{r}
#| label: recreation-data-1

# Do stuff here
```

### Recreate bar plot

Run the code chunk below to see a plot.

```{r}
#| label: recreate-me-1
#| message: false
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("images/recreate-me-1-1.png")
```

Use `ggplot()` and `geom_col()` in the chunk below to re-create the plot above using the `animal_counts` dataset. (*note*---the bars are filled, but there's no legend)

```{r}
#| label: recreation-plot-1

# Do stuff here
```


## Outcomes

What are the most common types of outcomes for animals taken to the shelter? What proportion are adopted or rescued?

### Recreate data summary

Use `group_by()` and `summarize()` and `mutate()` to create a data frame named `outcome_props` that looks like this (hint---that proportion column is calculated like `total / sum(total)`):

```
# A tibble: 9 × 3
  outcome_type            total proportion
  <chr>                   <int>      <dbl>
1 Adoption                 5651    0.214  
2 Community Cat             382    0.0145 
3 Died                      715    0.0271 
4 Euthanasia               5250    0.199  
5 Rescue                   6022    0.228  
6 Return To Owner          2579    0.0976 
7 Return To Wild Habitat    251    0.00950
8 Shelter, Neuter, Return   911    0.0345 
9 Transfer                 4652    0.176
```

```{r}
#| label: recreation-data-2

# Do stuff here
```

### Recreate lollipop plot

Run the code chunk below to see a plot.

```{r}
#| label: recreate-me-2
#| message: false
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("images/recreate-me-2-1.png")
```

Use `ggplot()` and `geom_pointrange()` in the chunk below to re-create the plot above using the `outcome_props` dataset.

```{r}
#| label: recreation-plot-2

# Do stuff here
```

Currently the outcome types are sorted alphabetically, which isn't super helpful. Sort them by proportion and recreate the plot below.

```{r}
#| label: recreate-me-3
#| message: false
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("images/recreate-me-3-1.png")
```

*Big hint!* Add this to the end of the code to make `outcome_props` to order `outcome_type` by the proportion column:

```r
CODE_FOR_OUTCOME_PROPS |> 
  mutate(outcome_type = fct_reorder(outcome_type, proportion))
```

```{r}
#| label: recreation-plot-3

# Do stuff here
```


## Intake type over time

Are there seasonal patterns in the types of animal intake at the shelter?

### Recreate data summary

Use `group_by()` and `summarize()` and `mutate()` to create a data frame named `month_intake_props` that looks like the output below.

You'll need to group by two variables to make the summary. IMPORTANTLY you'll also need to add another `group_by()` in between `summarize()` and `mutate()`, otherwise, R will calculate percentages in unexpected groups.

If you want the percentages of months to add up to 100% in each intake type (i.e. the percent of adoptions in January, February, March, etc.), you'll want to group by `intake_type` before calculating the proportion; if you want the percentages of intake types to add up to 100% in each month (i.e. the percent of all different intake types in January), you'll want to group by `intake_month` before calculating the proportion.

```
# A tibble: 36 × 4
# Groups:   intake_type [3]
   intake_type     intake_month total proportion
   <chr>           <ord>        <int>      <dbl>
 1 Owner Surrender January        196     0.0844
 2 Owner Surrender February       240     0.103 
 3 Owner Surrender March          254     0.109 
 4 Owner Surrender April          189     0.0814
 5 Owner Surrender May            206     0.0887
 6 Owner Surrender June           190     0.0818
 7 Owner Surrender July           165     0.0710
 8 Owner Surrender August         214     0.0921
 9 Owner Surrender September      175     0.0753
10 Owner Surrender October        167     0.0719
# ℹ 26 more rows
# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows
```

### Recreate heatmap

Run the code chunk below to see a plot.

```{r}
#| label: recreate-me-4
#| message: false
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("images/recreate-me-4-1.png")
```

Use `ggplot()` and `geom_tile()` in the chunk below to re-create the plot above using the `outcome_props` dataset.

*Hint*: By default, the months will appear reversed, with January at the bottom and December at the top. Use `y = fct_rev(intake_month)` to reverse them.

```{r}
#| label: recreation-plot-4

# Do stuff here
```

# Task 3: Extension

Copy the code for one of your plots above and paste it into the chunk below. Do some extra things to it, like changing the labels, changing the colors, adding a new geom, plotting a different variable from the dataset (there are lots of them!), changing the theme, or whatever. **This is your chance to play around and explore.**

```{r}
#| label: extension

# Do stuff here
```
