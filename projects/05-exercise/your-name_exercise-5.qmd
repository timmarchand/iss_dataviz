# Task 2: Cheese!

## Data description and cleaning

This data comes from [cheese.com](https://cheese.com/), and it was a [#TidyTuesday dataset in June 2024](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2024/2024-06-04)

There are 19 columns, and [they're documented here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2024/2024-06-04#data-dictionary)---make sure you consult that page!

The code below loads and cleans the data, resulting in a data frame named `cheeses_milk_country` that contains the number of cheeses made by the top 8 cheese-producing countries, across three types of milk. **You don't need to modify anything in this chunk of code---you only need to run it.**

```{r}
#| label: load-clean-data
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)

# Load the full data
cheeses_raw <- read_csv("data/cheeses.csv")

# The milk and country columns contain multiple values, like "cow, goat" and 
# "Italy, France". separate_longer_delim() splits those into separate rows 
# based on the ",", so that "cow, goat" would turn into one row for cow and one 
# for goat, and so on
cheeses <- cheeses_raw |> 
  separate_longer_delim(milk, delim = ", ") |> 
  separate_longer_delim(country, delim = ", ") |> 
  # Technically England, Scotland, GB, and the UK are all different things, but
  # for the sake of visualization, we can lump them all together
  mutate(country = case_match(country,
    "England" ~ "United Kingdom",
    "Great Britain" ~ "United Kingdom",
    "Scotland" ~ "United Kingdom",
    .default = country
  ))

# Find the most common milk types
top_milk_types <- cheeses |> 
  group_by(milk) |> 
  summarize(total = n()) |> 
  filter(total > 100)

# Find the most common countries
top_countries <- cheeses |> 
  group_by(country) |> 
  summarize(total = n()) |> 
  filter(total > 30)

# Calculate the number of milk types across the most common countries
cheeses_milk_country <- cheeses |> 
  filter(milk %in% top_milk_types$milk, country %in% top_countries$country) |> 
  group_by(milk, country) |> 
  summarize(total = n()) |> 
  ungroup() |> 
  # Capitalize the milk types
  mutate(milk = str_to_title(milk)) |> 
  # Sort by country and milk type and lock in the order for better plotting 
  arrange(desc(total), milk) |> 
  mutate(across(c(country, milk), \(x) fct_inorder(x)))
cheeses_milk_country
```


## Base plot

Here's a basic bar chart showing the counts of countries and milk types. It's stored as an object named `base_plot`:

```{r}
base_plot <- ggplot(
  cheeses_milk_country,
  aes(x = total, y = fct_rev(country), fill = milk)
) +
  geom_col() +
  guides(fill = "none") +
  # These colors come from ColorBrewer 2:
  # https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=qualitative&scheme=Set1&n=3
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  facet_wrap(vars(milk))
base_plot
```


### Recreate nice plot

Run the code chunk below to see a plot.

```{r}
#| label: recreate-me-1
#| message: false
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("images/recreate-me-plot-1-1.png")
```

Your job is to use `labs()` and `theme()` to recreate this plot:

**Some helpful big hints:**

- The image is 6 inches wide and 3 inches tall. Use chunk options like `fig-width` and `fig-height` to control the dimensions (see <https://datavizsp26.classes.andrewheiss.com/resource/quarto.html#chunk-options>)
- Use `labs()` to modify the following things: `x`, `y`, `title`, `subtitle`, and `caption`
- Use `theme_bw()`
- Use `theme()` to adjust these things:
  - Strip text
  - Axis title
  - Panel grid major
  - Plot title
  - Plot subtitle
  - Plot caption

In the end, your code will look something like this:

```{.r}
base_plot + 
  labs(x = "BLAH", title = "BLAH") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    strip.text = element_text(BLAH),
    axis.title = element_text(BLAH)
  )
```

**MAKE SURE** you use [the theme resources and cheatsheets from the content page](https://datavizsp26.classes.andrewheiss.com/content/05-content.html#readings-you-should-glance-through-and-use-as-resources). Also [consider using {ggthemeassist}](https://datavizsp26.classes.andrewheiss.com/example/05-example.html#bonus-ggthemeassist) to help with the different settings.

```{r}
#| label: recreation-plot-1

# Do stuff here
```

# Task 3: ~~Extension~~ Ugly plot

For your extension, forget all the wonderful CRAP design principles you just learned and try your hardest to **make the ugliest plot in the world**. Take `base_plot` and create the worst, ugliest, least CRAPful plot ever.

Change the colors, modify the theme, add labels, etc. and make this ugly. You can leave the `geom_col()` as is, or you can mess with it too (or even change it to a pie chart or heatmap or something if you feel up to it).

**This is your chance to play around and explore.**

```{r}
#| label: ugly-extension

# Do stuff here

base_plot +
  theme()
```
