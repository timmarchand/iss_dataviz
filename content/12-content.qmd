More {sf} fun times:

- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} If you want to understand how the magic `geometry` column actually works, check out [this fantastic post](https://www.jessesadler.com/post/simple-feature-objects/).
- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} Check out [this post where someone used {ggplot2} and {sf} to create fancy city map-based art that she printed for a friend](https://www.katiejolly.io/blog/2019-01-21/map-cutouts). You can do similar things after this session!
- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} In addition to the example for this session, you can [check out this tutorial on using the {sf} package to create maps](https://r-spatial.org//r/2018/10/25/ggplot2-sf.html). It shows how to include fancy map stuff like a north arrow and scale bar.
