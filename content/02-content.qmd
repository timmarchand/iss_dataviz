## Readings

### Required readings

Foundational principles:

- {{< fa book >}} Chapter 5 in *The Truthful Art* [@Cairo:2016]
- {{< fa book >}} [Chapter 4](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/color-basics.html) and [Chapter 27](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/image-file-formats.html) in *Fundamentals of Data Visualization* [@Wilke:2018]

Graphic design principles:

- {{< fa file-pdf >}} [Summary of CRAP graphic design principles](https://web.archive.org/web/20170712142203/http://www.presentationzen.com/chapter6_spread.pdf) from *Presentation Zen* [@Reynolds:2008] + [this summary here](https://www.lewisu.edu/writingcenter/pdf/crap-resource-revised-pub.pdf). These principles are from Robin Williams' [*The Non-Designer's Design & Type Books*](https://www.amazon.com/Non-Designers-Design-Book-4th/dp/0133966151) [@Williams:2008], which you should really get if you're interested in doing anything design-related ever. Her stuff is life-changing.
- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} [Color palettes](/resource/colors.qmd)
- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} [Typography in ten minutes](https://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html). The rest of the *Practical Typography* book is phenomenal and you'd be remiss if you didn't read the whole thing and bookmark it for life, but for now just read this quick summary.
- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} ["File formats explained"](https://www.theglowstudio.com/file-formats-explained/)

### Readings you should glance through and use as resources

CRAP:

- {{< fa brands youtube >}} [4 Foundational UI Design Principles | C.R.A.P.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwNClNmekGU). This is another quick explanation of CRAP and a walkthrough of redesiging something boring/ugly with CRAP principles in mine

Colors: 

- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} Cédric Scherer, ["Colors and emotions in data visualization"](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2021/6/8/colors-and-emotions-in-data-visualization)
- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} Lisa Charlotte Muth, ["Emphasize what you want readers to see with colors"](https://blog.datawrapper.de/emphasize-with-color-in-data-visualizations/)
- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} Lisa Charlotte Muth, ["How to find & create good color palettes"](https://blog.datawrapper.de/create-good-color-palettes/).
- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} Lisa Charlotte Muth, ["A detailed guide to colors in data vis style guides"](https://blog.datawrapper.de/colors-for-data-vis-style-guides/). You can skim this—this is a good resource for future you.

Fonts:

- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} [Font Matrix – See & Pair Typefaces Like Never Before](https://pimpmytype.com/font-matrix/). In the videos, I mention that you should use contrasting font families, like choosing a sans serif and a serif font. But in reality, mixing fonts well is more complicated than that. The designer here presents something called the [Font Matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=731-k8xSyqE) that will help you find good font combinations.


## Slides

The slides for this week's lesson are available online as an HTML file. Use the buttons below to open the slides either as an interactive website or as a static PDF (for printing or storing for later). You can also click in the slides below and navigate through them with your left and right arrow keys.

```{r show-slide-tabs, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}

  ratio = "16:9",
  border = "none",
  margin = "0 auto"
)
```

**Fun fact**: If you type <kbd>?</kbd> (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>) while going through the slides, you can see a list of special slide-specific commands.
