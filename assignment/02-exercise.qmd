### Quarto is optional

You don't need to worry about using Quarto for this assignment, unless you want to (I encourage you to try using Quarto though!). You can put your check-in and other writing in regular Word document and submit that.

## Task 1: Session check-in

Write your [session check-in](/assignment/session-check-in.qmd) for the session's readings.

::: {.callout-tip}
### Check-in reminder

Remember to do this for your check-in:

> Three interesting or exciting things:
> 
> 1. Something
> 2. Something
> 3. Something
> 
> Three muddy or unclear things:
> 
> 1. Something
> 2. Something
> 3. Something

## Task 2: Poster redesign

Here's a typical poster you might see in your workplace or on campus. (I found this on a table on the 6th floor in 55 Park Place near the economics department)

**Do the four tasks below while consulting this poster**

```{r project-structure, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/projects/02-exercise/excen-flyer.jpg", error = FALSE)
```

### Part 1: Audience analysis

In 1–2 paragraphs, discuss these things:

- Who is the main audience for this poster?
- In what setting will people see this? How much time will they have to interact with it?
- What kind of information do they need to know?
- What's the most important piece of information they need?
- What should the audience do as a result of seeing this poster?

### Part 2: CRAP critique

Critique the design of the poster. Go through the CRAP checklist and analyze how well or poorly the poster follows each of the principles. Discuss how the poster's adherence to (or non-adherence to) these principles influences its effectiveness.

### Part 3: CRAP redesign

Based on your audience analysis and critique of the original poster, redesign this poster. Use whatever program you want—even PowerPoint if you're most comfortable with that, though it'll probably be easier to use something like [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) or Adobe Illustrator. If you use Canva, don't use any of the built-in templates—start from scratch with a blank page.

To save you from retyping everything, I've included all the text, the logo, and the QR code in the zip file below:

### Don't use everything!

You don't have to use every piece of text and every image from the original poster. You probably shouldn't! Make this new version fit with your audience analysis while following the CRAP graphic design principles.
:::

### Part 4: Redesign critique

In 1–2 paragraphs, critique your new design using the CRAP checklist. How did you use contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity in your improved design? How does this new version meet the audience's needs?


## Turning everything in

On iCollege, submit a PDF of your new poster, along with a PDF of your check-in and all the other writing tasks.
